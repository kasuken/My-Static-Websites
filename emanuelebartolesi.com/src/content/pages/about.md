I'm a **Microsoft 365 Architect** but I was born as a Full Stack Web Developer.

I have a strong passion about frontend technologies and everything related to the cloud, especially Microsoft Azure.

I currently live in Zurich and actively participate in local and international community activities and events.

I love to expertiment and since 2018 I have started to stream on Twitch as a live coder. I am the first italian live coder on Twitch that became a Twitch Affiliate. 
<br />You can follow me at https://twitch.tv/kasuken to write some code together.

Since 2014 I'm Microsoft MVP in the Developer Technologies category.

In the last 8 years I delivered a lot of session at events focused on topics like: web development, cloud and AI.
In addition I had organized a lot of events as producer and one of the responsible of the agenda.

If you are interested to involve me in your events, drop me a line from [here](/contact).

Since 2018 I am a live coder on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/kasuken). I am first italian on the platform as live coder and I am happy about it.
<br />For me it was and is a good opportunity for job opportunities and for personal branding.
<br />It helps for my imposter syndrome. :)
