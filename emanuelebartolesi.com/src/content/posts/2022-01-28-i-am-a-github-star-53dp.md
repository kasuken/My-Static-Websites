The GitHub Stars program thanks GitHub’s most influential developers and gives them a platform to showcase their work, reach more people, and shape the future of GitHub.

This is **the essence of the GitHub Stars program** and I ❤️ it.

I am very happy to announce that today I have been accepted as GitHub Star ⭐.
It's an honor for me to be recognized.

When I saw the others members this morning I told to myself "ehy, what the hell are you doing here!?!?" but at the same time **I am motivated to continue to share my knowledge** during the events, on my videos and on my Twitch channel.

GitHub, for me, is the first site I visit in the morning and the last one I view before I go to bed at night.
I also use it to see other people's code, which is one of the best ways to learn.

And now it's time to take a rest and wait for the swag in the next few weeks :)
