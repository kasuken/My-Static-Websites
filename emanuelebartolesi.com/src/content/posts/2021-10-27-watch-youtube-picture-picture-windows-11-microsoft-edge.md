I don't like to do multitask activities, but sometimes I want to watch a tutorial on YouTube and reproduce the same step on my tools.
The best option to do that is using the Picture-in-Picture feature of the modern browsers.

In this article I will show you how to do it with Microsoft Edge, but you can use Chrome or Firefox as well.

Launch your favorite browser and find the video that you want to put on PiP.
Click twice with the right button of the mouse.
You can click everywhere on the video canvas and after the first click, move the mouse pointer a little bit and click again.

The built-in menu of the video player should be appear.
Now you can click on "Picture in Picture" item.

Drag the new window with the small video on your favorite area of your screen and, in addition, you can also resize the player.
