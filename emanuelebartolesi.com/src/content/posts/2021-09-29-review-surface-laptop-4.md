In the last years I used a Surface Book 2 and, later, a Surface Book 3 as my main productivity laptop.
I was quite happy but not totally happy, especially regarding the performance of both of them.
One year ago I bought a gaming pc for working from home, but sometimes I use the laptop for working from the balcony or from another room in my home.
On the 2nd of August (I will write an article on it the next month) I joined [SoftwareONE](https://www.softwareone.com) as a Microsoft 365 Architect and, of course, I still continue to write a lot of code.

#The Laptop

As main laptop for working, I received a Surface Laptop 4.
The specs are:
- Screen: 13.5” PixelSense™ Display
- Resolution: 2256 x 1504 (201 PPI)
- Memory: 32GB LPDDR4x RAM
- Processor: Quad Core 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-1135G7
- Wifi 6
- Bluetooth 5
- Weight: 1,288 g
- Storage: 512 GB

#Initial thoughts
Honestly, I don't have good expectations from this laptop because of my past experiences with other Microsoft laptop.
I am pleased with the feeling when you bring the laptop on your hands.
It seems very solid and, first of all, it's very light.
The display is really good and I set the DPI to 125%. I use the same settings on my old laptops as well.

I am impressed because Windows 10 seems really fluid, also when I working hard with the HDD (npm install, delete big folders and stuff like that).
The battery is good. Not super great, but good. I can work with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Edge, Windows Terminal and Teams up to 5 hours.

I use the Logitech MX Master as my main mouse, but the trackpad is the best trackpad that I used on a laptop (not like the Apple trackpad on the Macbook, but it's good!).

#Final thoughts
I am excited about the laptop. I don't use the laptop very often but when I use it (in the last 15 days I worked only on it) I don't feeling lost without my gaming pc at home.
