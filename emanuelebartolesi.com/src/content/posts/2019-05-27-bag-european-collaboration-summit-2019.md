In the next days I will go as attendee and one of the [Diamond Sponsor](https://www.collabsummit.eu/sponsors) at the most important conference in Europe about collaboration: [European Collaboration Summit](https://www.collabsummit.eu).
I will try to record some videos and podcasts from there with my stuff.
Maybe, if I have a good connection, I will try to do a live on Twitch.
This is why I will bring with me all the things in the list below.

## In my bag

* My [Microsoft Surface Book 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-book-2/8mcpzjjcc98c?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) with my Logitech MX Master and the [Surface Pen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/penna-per-surface/8zl5c82qmg6b?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab).
It's perfect to take handwritten notes during the awesome sessions.
I use also my Surface as primary device to do some live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/kasuken) during the days of the conference

* my main USB Microphone: it's perfect to record a podcast episode or for Twitch

* The [Surface Headphones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-headphones/8nrm8dz2zw43?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) is good if I have to do some call with the customers during the event or if need to work some hours with no distractions

* My iPad. I will use this device to record some videos. I have also an additional microphone in the metal box.

* A big tripod. It's useful to record some videos with my iPad and also if I need to find a good position for the webcam for Twitch.

* [My Garmin 920xt](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/pn/010-01174-00) is always on my wrist. This time I don't have a gym in the hotel. Maybe I will rest for two days.

*  [Logitech C920 Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Widescreen-Calling-Recording-Desktop/dp/B006JH8T3S): it's my main webcam at home for Twitch or calls with Skype and Teams. I will use this device also for a remote live coding streaming or to record videos.

* 40000mAh Powerbank. All day at the event, some photos and video. I need a lot of battery power with me.

* cables, cables, cables: I have some cables and some adapters in my two "little" bag. I use the metal one with my streaming and recording stuff. I try this setup for the first time but I have my stuff well organized in my bag.

* Sony a290. It's my old reflex. I am not a great photographer, but I want to learn to take some good photo with that.

* [Moza Gymbal](https://www.amazon.com/MOZA-Mini-S-Extendable-Smartphone-One-Button/dp/B07QD4WJN3): this is a new entry! If I want to do good videos, I need more quality. This is the reason why I have this geek thing. :)
