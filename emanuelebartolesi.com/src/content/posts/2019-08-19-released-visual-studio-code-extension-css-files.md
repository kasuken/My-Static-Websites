Today I released a new extension for Visual Studio Code that works with CSS, Less, Sass and SCSS files.

With it you can see the initial values for every single CSS property.
It's an easy to use extension: you have to just hover your mouse point on a property and you see the initial value from that property.
It helps to understand issues on your UI or just to know the initial value of a property.

To document the properties, the extension uses the official database from Mozilla Development Network released on GitHub: https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/properties.json

The initial value property it's supported in (almost) every browsers.

Below you can see a working demo of the extension.
