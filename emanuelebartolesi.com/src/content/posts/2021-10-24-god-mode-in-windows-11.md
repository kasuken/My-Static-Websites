One of the main improvements in Windows 11 is the new Settings screen, which is better organized than in the previous version.
In terms of versatility, however, it is still inferior to the dear old fashion Control Panel, and some options present here are missing on the more modern interface.
To the rescue comes **God Mode**, a screen that the user can easily activate.

God Mode is nothing more than a configuration page that allows the user to **quickly access all the advanced customization and configuration tools**, system features and much more.

## How to activate the God Mode

To access God Mode on Windows 11 you simply need to create a folder on your desktop renaming it to:

GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}

Once done you'll need to double-click on the new icon to access the God Mode screen, which will be presented inside a File Explorer window.
