My editor choice is Visual Studio Code since the first beta release.
I like personalize everything in my editor and Visual Studio Code is perfect in this way.

Here I will show my Top 5 favourite Visual Studio Code theme.


# [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)

One of the best theme for Visual Studio Code (and others editor!!!).
This is my current theme for work.

# [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis)

My second favourite theme, after Night Owl.
This is the best to relax your eyes after a long working day.

## Plus

### [Power Mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-power-mode)

It's not a real theme, but I like this effect when I have a presentation or a demo with customer. :)
